# The beginning
{{< figure src="/img/qbasic.png" alt="QBasic Opening Screen" class="about-me" >}}

I discovered my first program while searching for games to play on a
local BBS. I was 9 or 10 and I downloaded a QBASIC program that was a
fortune teller. Being able to see the code was all it took. I was
hooked.

# Into the deep end

When I was 13 I asked my parents to get me a C++ compiler for
Christmas. I still remember how overwhelmed I felt trying to learn C++
in the pre-google days by going through all those manuals.

# The rest is history

I have never lost the bug. Vacations not withstanding I haven't gone
more than 2 or 3 days without writing code since that day I discovered
QBASIC. Writing code is something I have to do. Over the years I've
developed a strong interest in treating programming as a craft. I
really believe that we should put the same level of love, care, and
quality into our code that a master craftsman puts into his work.

Few things give me more satisfaction than that moment of joy when I
finally figure out a hard problem. I want to apply my love of problem
solving and programming to help change the world.

I am intrinsically curious, a continuous learner, and I am constantly
looking to solve problems in new ways.
