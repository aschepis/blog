This morning at [CloudHealth](http://www.cloudhealthtech.com/) we had
the best sprint retrospective we've had during my entire tenure (5
months already!?) Let me tell you why.

The sprint itself was really productive. We delivered a lot of value
to our customers, we responded promptly to customer issues, and we
moved ourselves forward strategically. That being said, no codebase,
process, product, or engineer is perfect. We've all go our strengths,
weaknesses, tendencies, and pet peeves. We all have opinions on what
is done well, and what isn't working.

At this retro our CTO [Joe](http://hightechinthehub.com) really
encouraged us to take the gloves off and get brutally honest about
what isn't working. Don't take anything personally, but let's get it
all out there. Once we got started it got __really real__ in the
room. There were some tense moments but in my opinion it brought the
true priorities to the surface.

I found the experience really refreshing. Honesty can hurt and
sometimes we don't want to hear it, but you can't truly mesh as a team
without it. We all got to know each other a bit better today and I
think we're all better for it. And when the team gets better, the
product and the company benefit.

It occurred to me afterwards that this brutal honestly is a key part
to making any process work.  Honest with each other, but more
importantly honest with ourselves. Decisions made with a firm grasp on
reality are decisions made on solid ground. This is much better than
making decisions based on whatever stories or mythologies you and your
peers have invented about how things are.
