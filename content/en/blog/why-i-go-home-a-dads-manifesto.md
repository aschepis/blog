**TL;DR I love my job, I love my career, I love solving hard problems,
and I love crafting great software. Just not as much as a I love my
daughter.**

When I was younger, i was one of the developers who would get to work
early, code all day, leave the office after everybody else, and then
get back online and code at night. It didn't matter what I was coding
on, I just wanted to be coding. Then a funny thing happened. My wife
and I had a baby.

When I found out that Jen was pregnant I was ecstatic. Not only
because getting to that point was a difficult process, but because I
have always known that I wanted children. I wanted to be a father. No,
I wanted to be a great father. I made a promise to myself and my
unborn child that I would, at the very least, be a father who was
present, and around, and available.

At this point you may be thinking "How is that going to work? The
caffeine-fueled, crunch-time, death march prone careers of developers
don't exactly jive with being home for dinner." This is true. For me
this came down to priorities and a simple realization: If you screw up
at your job you can always get another one, but if you screw up your
family, especially your relationship with your children, it will stay
with you and stay screwed up forever.

So I made the choice that I would be home to spend time with my
daughter everyday, even if it was going to adversely affect my
career. So I get to the office around 6:30-6:45am every day, I put in
about 9 solid hours of work, and I take off to head home around
4pm. The hours between 4:30 and 7:30pm are sacred. They belong to my
daughter. The hardest part about this is that I work with a lot of
people on the west coast (who, as a function of culture tend to start
their days later) and its very natural for them to schedule meetings
at 2pm or 3pm PST. This directly conflicts with the time I have set
aside for playing with my daughter, so I try to reschedule or decline
most of these meetings. Of course, I try to be pragmatic and if
something incredibly important comes up on the job I will be here, no
matter what the time. The bar is pretty high though, and the reason
for that goes back to my earlier realization. Once my daughter is in
bed I am free to spend time with my wife, code on something else, or
work if its necessary. Calling into an 8pm or 9pm meeting with
west-coast teams is not unheard of.

At first I had a lot of guilt about leaving my comrades behind to
suffer during hard times. That was reinforced during my performance
appraisal when one of the pieces of feedback I got through our peer
review process was that as a team leader, it would be nice if i was
around when the team had to stay late. But if you look at the
breakdown of my time, I spend 9+ hours working each day, and only 3
with my daughter. If that's unfair to anyone, its unfair to my
daughter.

By doing this I've actually discovered that I can be more productive
when I get away from the code for a while. I drive home, play with my
daughter, eat dinner, bathe her, read her books, and put her to
bed. All this time my brain is still spinning. My subconscious is
still tossing problems around and searching for solutions. There is
plenty of research that shows the benefits of taking breaks from hard
problems if you want to solve them. Plus, few things keep you on your
toes like playing with a precocious two year old.

Sure, I don't pump out the same sheer volume of code that I used to
partly because these days I spend more time mentoring, but also
because the lines of code I do write are better.)

Another ancillary benefit I discovered is that I don't feel as burned
out. Death marches and late nights take a lot out of you. As a result
you . Nowadays I come into the office energized with my thoughts
organized and ready to put in solid hours at work. When you work crazy
hours you yo-yo between 20 hour days and 8 hour days that really only
have a few hours of productivity (or none at all!) Decision making
suffers when you are overtired, and you fall behind on everything else
outside of your job that needs to get done. To make matters worse,
this trend is self-amplifying. You go crazy trying to finish one
project because the demands were unreasonable or it was poorly
scheduled or estimated (or other legitimate stuff came up, but
schedule didn't budge) and so you necessarily go easy at the beginning
of the next cycle or project because you are burned out. This causes
you to fall behind and dooms you to another round of late nights and
misery.

Even if you don't have a great reason like I did, kick the death
marches to the curb. You may even find that prioritizing a few hours
to spend on some worthy pursuit outside of work will make you even
better at your job. While you're at it, pick up a copy of
[Rework](http://37signals.com/rework/) from the guys at
