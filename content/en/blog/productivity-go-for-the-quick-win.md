A couple of months ago my boss and I were talking about bug fixing and
how there are some developers who seem to be able to get things done
everyday without exception while others seem to get stuck on a single
issue for days and then finally get through it and then continue to
get work done. I told him about how I try to stay productive and keep
myself motivated. It all comes down to going for the quick win as soon
as I get into the office.

Even when i'm working on a difficult problem, writing a long document,
or working on a multi-day code change I make sure to start my day off
with something that I can accomplish quickly. This is the quick
win. Success breeds success. Small victories will prepare you and
motivate you to go after the big victories with even more zeal.

The days where i'm able to get a quick win during the first 30 minutes
or hour of my day are typically my best days. I'm motivated by success
and progress and that builds enthusiasm to get more done and to help
other get things done.

Give it a try the next time you're bogged down with a tough defect or
long-term problem to solve. Go for a quick win, have some success, and
you'll find that you are even more motivated to tackle the more
challenging things sitting in front of you. Do you have any tricks of
your own for staying productive?
