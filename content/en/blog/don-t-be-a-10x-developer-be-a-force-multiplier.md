[CloudHealth](http://www.cloudhealthtech.com/) is growing really fast and on the
engineering team we have reached the size where we are starting to bring in more
junior developers. For us this means developers who have great talent and ability
but are just out of school or recently out of school. I like to say that these
girls and guys have horsepower.

Junior developers are not a blank slate, but they are about as close as you get
in our industry. This means that as an organization we have an opportunity (an
obligation even) to help these developers become great. I was extremely
fortunate to have a number of incredible mentors during my formative years
as a professional software engineer. To pay this forward I strive to be
a great mentor to any junior engineers I work with.

There is some research that indicates that the most productive developers
are 10x more productive than their average counterparts (see
[The 10x Developer is NOT a myth](http://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2013/09/29/the-10x-developer-is-not-myth/)
for some context and one opinion on the matter.)

Whether you believe in the 10x developer or not, I believe that there is an even more
important trait to strive for and develop in other software engineers.

[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_multiplication) a
force multiplier is  "a factor that dramatically increases (hence "multiplies")
the effectiveness of an item or group." Leaders and senior members of an
engineering team have a duty to help other team members become better and
be more effective. They should act as force multipliers for the engineering
organization.

A developer who makes everyone around him better is even more
valuable than a single developer who is much better than all the others. If
you hire well I believe that this is a more scalable approach to building
a great engineer team as well.

Am I a 10x developer? Probably not. At this point in my career thats not
as important to me as being a force multiplier.
