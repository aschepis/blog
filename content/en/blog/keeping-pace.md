I've been at my new job at
[CloudHealth Technologies](http://cloudhealthtech.com) for about two
months now. I feel incredibly grateful to be able to work with such a
talented team and to have the opportunity to tackle hard problems in
an increasingly interesting space. Additionally, I've learned a few
things over the past 60 days now that i've switched from being a
consumer of cloud services to a provider of value on top of cloud
services.

Being a consumer of cloud services I look forward to new announcements
from cloud vendors like Amazon, Google, and Digital Ocean. Whenever
something new and cool is announced I think of the ways that I might
use it and the way that it might make my product better or my job more
productive.

Being a developer of a service that helps companies make the best use
of the cloud puts these announcements into an entirely different
light. I'm still excited to hear about them but it also means that
we're going to have to quickly figure out our strategy and implement
it.

For instance, Amazon recently announced a massive overhaul of their
Reserved Instance model. No sooner was it announced than our customers
started asking us about when we would support it. Being fairly new, I
wasn't in the direct line of fire but the whole team banded together,
put our heads down and added support for new reservation types to the
product in a few days.

For us, announcements signal the possibility for a frenzy of
development. It doesn't matter if it happens mid-sprint or during the
holiday season. If this all sounds stressful, thats because it is. But
its the best kind of stress. We're given a challenge and an
opportunity to provide new value to our customers immediately. It
helps that i'm working with a team of really bright, focused
individuals all pulling in the same direction. When we put that code
into production you can feel the sense of pride throughout the
team. Then we go back to our stories for the current sprint and await
the "Next Big Thing."
