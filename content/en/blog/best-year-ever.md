Today marks my 1 year anniversary at
[CloudHealth Technologies](http://www.cloudhealthtech.com/). This last
year has been a whirlwind to say the least. While today marks the
anniversary of my start date at CloudHealth the story actually begins
several months earlier.

In 2014 I was working at
[Springboard Retail](http://springboardretail.com) who, I might add,
are doing some awesome things in the retail space. On June 24, 2014 I
got a message on
[Stack Overflow Careers](http://careers.stackoverflow.com) from a guy
named [Joe Kinsella](http://hightechinthehub.com) wondering if I
might be interested in exploring opportunities at his startup. It was
not your typical cookie-cutter recruiting email, his startup looked
really interesting, right in my wheelhouse, and he just seemed like a
guy i'd like to get to know.

I let Joe know that I wasn't interested in exploring new
opportunities, but that I would love to meet for coffee and talk about
tech and what we were each doing. We met up for coffee at Flour Cafe
in Boston and had a great discussion about our backgrounds, and our
thoughts about the cloud and the future of the cloud. As Joe told me
about his vision for CloudHealth I was immediately full of ideas and
possibilities of what could be done. We had a great conversation and I
walked away knowing that I would keep my eye on CloudHealth.

While I was very interested in CloudHealth I was still intent on
staying where I was.  I had been at Springboard for less than two
years and I felt that I had an obligation to see things through a bit
further (I was engineer #2, and the first engineering hire.)

Two days later I got an email from Joe introducing me to the
CloudHealth CEO Dan Phillips. Dan was interested in meeting as well. I
went to the CloudHealth offices and had a great conversation with Dan
about the Boston startup community, and startups in general. That
night I had a conversation with my wife and told her that I
felt I should stay at Springboard a bit longer, but that I could
definitely see myself at CloudHealth in the future.

Over the next month or so I was hard at work at Springboard doing
really cool things like writing a cross-platform C library for
interacting with POS hardware for the Springboard Windows, Mac, and
iOS software. This was super fun but there was a thread running in the
back of my brain that kept repeating "What do you want to do with your
career?" I knew that retail was not my passion. My passions lie in
scalability, distributed systems, the cloud, and building and
understanding complex infrastructures.

Joe reached about to me again in August and asked if I wanted to catch
up. A quote from my response:

> Two of the thoughts that have been rather persistent at the back of
> my mind lately are “I don’t really want to be a Retail/POS
> expert. It isn’t my passion” and “I should check back in with Joe.”

The rest is history, as they say. I met the team, interviewed, was
wowed by level of the engineering team and by just how deep the
CloudHealth platform already was giving the company's youth. Joe gave
me an offer at Barlow's restaurant on A St. I talked it over with my
wife that night and we decided together that CloudHealth was the right
place for me.

As an interesting aside: As this process was really kicking into gear
I got a recruiting email about a "Core Engineering Team Position at
CloudHealth." I informed the recruiter that Joe and I were already
talking. I found it very serendipitous and I couldn't help but feel
like CloudHealth and I were meant to be.

It was hard to leave Springboard Retail. They were really small at
the time and I felt like I was abandoning them. I've been heartened
to see how far they have come in the last year as well. I've kept
in touch with most of the people there (though not as frequently as
I would like) and I wish them all the success in the world.

I started a few weeks before AWS re:Invent 2014 and I was immediately
thrown into the fire, just the way I wanted it. I merged my first Pull
Request on my first day and its been that way ever since.

One of the most memorable parts of my first six weeks at CloudHealth
allowed me to marry my love of building systems with my past
experience writing C++ and building desktop applications. We hit an
honest to goodness Chrome bug that was triggered by our charting
library under some circumstances. In order to prove it I got to go all
the way down to 2D drawing library in chrome where the error
occurred. We logged a bug with the Chrome team and it ended up getting
fixed in the next major version.

From there I have traveled around to various projects and features
within the platform doing what I do best: shipping software! I've
gotten into every part of the system. I've been given the opportunity
to take on and solve big problems, learn new things from incredibly
bright people, bring new engineers along, and take the helm building
one of the coolest, most forward-thinking aspects of our platform.

It came full circle a few weeks ago in the ramp up to
[AWS re:Invent 2015](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/). We had the
opportunity to build an integration with a new service
([AWS Config Rules](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-config-rules-dynamic-compliance-checking-for-cloud-resources/))
prior to public announcement. I spent my last 10 days prior to
re:Invent getting this built into the platform

I have been *incredibly* fortunate in my career. I had incredible
mentors early on who guided me through a period of explosive career
and technical growth. I remember those years very fondly and I'm
grateful that I have had those people in my life. I was given the
opportunity to take leadership positions as I matured, and to help
bring others along. This is where I finally realized that the hardest
problems in technology are the soft problems. The people problems. The
greatest rewards also come from interactions with people (friends,
family, co-workers, customers.)

With that all being said this past year has without a doubt been the
best year of my career. The excitement of a startup that feels like
its on a rocketship, the buzz, the velocity, the sweat, the intensity,
the learning, the sleepless nights, the wins, the losses, the laughs,
and the people. Most importantly the people.
